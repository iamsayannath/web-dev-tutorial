Motivation behind object oriented programming (OOP)

Suppose I am Elon Musk. I own a big company called Tesla which manufactures electric cars. 
I think of manufacturing a new type of vehicle called Tesla Cybertruck - a competitor of Isuzu(pick up truck)

How do I even go about it?
What the team does is come up with a huge design file CyberTruck which has all the specifications and recipe for creating a Tesla cybertruck

On 1st jan,2023,the tesla fatcory has started manufacturing cybertrucks
# Cybtertruck#1 - It was manufactured at 9:05 AM using the design file
# Cybertruck#2 - It was manfucatured at 9:10 AM using the same design file.

# We are trying to introduce some sort of abstraction.

# in OOP, we will say that Cybtertruck#1 is an instance/object/realisation of class CyberTruck

# A class is a blueprint or a template to create objects of similar properties and behaviors.
